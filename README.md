# databaes_meetScribe

After sitting through one too many endless meetings, we figured, why not let an AI take notes, summarise the chaos, and even tell us who's slacking?

## Features:
- **Speaker Diarization**: Automatically tracks who’s talking (no more "who said that?" confusion).
- **Context-Aware Summaries**: Turns hours of conversation into bite-sized, meaningful summaries.
- **Action Point Extraction**: Pulls out tasks, so your "to-do" list basically writes itself.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Get the emotional tone of the conversation—whether it’s all high-fives or a slow burn toward chaos.

This project is a work in progress. Features and functionality will be added as we move forward.

Let’s get done with this, yeah.
