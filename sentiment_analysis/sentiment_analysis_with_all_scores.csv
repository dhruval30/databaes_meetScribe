Speaker C,"So I wanted to share with everyone that the survey that I've been working on putting together is going into qualtrics later today. What this means for everyone is that hopefully tomorrow I will have the survey ready and I would really appreciate everyone on the team if you could go through the survey yourself and just kind of record what your experience was like. This is just a chance for me to test out, to make sure the questions make sense, that they are lining up with your expectations as an engineer. And I'm hoping to get that wrapped up so that we can actually share it next week. So that's just a heads up on reviewing it. The other thing I would like to talk about, and maybe we could take this to an async conversation, is more around how do we get this survey out? We need to get a lot of people, a little bit over a thousand, to get a good confidence rate. So that's a lot of people. So trying to figure out creative ways to get more people to take the survey would be really helpful if I can get everyone's insights on that. So just want to give everyone a heads up that's coming. That's going to be this week and next week. So just kind of think on it and we'll touch base from there.","{'anger': 0.0063418741337955, 'disgust': 0.004816632717847824, 'fear': 0.0012572602136060596, 'joy': 0.14541101455688477, 'neutral': 0.7926458716392517, 'sadness': 0.010947748087346554, 'surprise': 0.03857953101396561}",0.0063418741337955,0.004816632717847824,0.0012572602136060596,0.14541101455688477,0.7926458716392517,0.010947748087346554,0.03857953101396561,1

For everyone who doesn't know, is she helping with getting the survey out that they have an existing panel that they could send the survey to?","{'anger': 0.010896692983806133, 'disgust': 0.012987247668206692, 'fear': 0.0027575406711548567, 'joy': 0.008783698081970215, 'neutral': 0.7254763245582581, 'sadness': 0.006476386915892363, 'surprise': 0.23262208700180054}",0.010896692983806133,0.012987247668206692,0.0027575406711548567,0.008783698081970215,0.7254763245582581,0.006476386915892363,0.23262208700180054,2
Speaker C,"Yep, they're going to send it to the existing panel. The panel isn't very large, so this is something that we'll probably have to find some other creative ways to get people to take the survey. Whether it's pinging people that are writing on our issues or start sharing it on Twitter, there's a couple different options.","{'anger': 0.05962609127163887, 'disgust': 0.17856550216674805, 'fear': 0.0015438346890732646, 'joy': 0.0417243055999279, 'neutral': 0.6740344762802124, 'sadness': 0.03451402485370636, 'surprise': 0.00999178271740675}",0.05962609127163887,0.17856550216674805,0.0015438346890732646,0.0417243055999279,0.6740344762802124,0.03451402485370636,0.00999178271740675,2
Speaker A,"Okay, cool. All right, so the next item I have is reviewing the 12.4 milestone. So I have the link included there to just pull up the issue list. If you want to pull it up. I have it sorted. I know Dan hates when I share my screen, but I have it sorted to manual. If you look in the sort dropdown box, the manual sort will pick up the sort that I included in the board list. So it's in priority order and then we could go through each item there. Sound good? Okay, so the first item on there is the Docker distribution pruner from experimental to GA. This could be an investigation task. This is. Dan and I were talking last week about whether or not we should prioritize forking the docker code and optimizing the garbage collection code that's there, or taking what Camille has already done with this docker distribution. Distribution pruner code, which is working for some customers. Sarah mentioned she's using this for some people on support calls, but it's. I've seen where there's issues with back. It causes issues with backups or some other things where it just doesn't work. But we thought this would be the fastest way to improving the garbage collection story for some of our big customers, some that we met with last week that are having, you know, 55 terabytes of storage that they're using in their registry, and they just can't use the current version of garbage collection. So in this issue, it's. It links to Camille's code, a little bit of the history, but really we need to, like, dive in and investigate and find out if that's possible. And probably a conversation with Camille is worth worthwhile to see what. What he thinks as well.","{'anger': 0.011838334612548351, 'disgust': 0.01448939461261034, 'fear': 0.000925401458516717, 'joy': 0.00568467378616333, 'neutral': 0.9563963413238525, 'sadness': 0.0029068163130432367, 'surprise': 0.0077590723522007465}",0.011838334612548351,0.01448939461261034,0.000925401458516717,0.00568467378616333,0.9563963413238525,0.0029068163130432367,0.0077590723522007465,3
Speaker D,"So sorry to interject, Tim. Yeah. I've been looking through the code and the list of issues. Most of the issues in that project, kind of, at best, a year old. So I think I've been trying to go through those issues to see if there's anything we can sort of start addressing relatively quickly, but we might end up having to. And this is the issues in the. What is it? The package. What if the pruner. Sorry, the container registry pruner. Doctor distribution pruner, or whatever he's called it. So I've been trying to go through these issues to figure out if there's anything that we can actually just kind of go, hey, let's go do this. And it seems like a lot of them is back and forward with people who are trying to contribute. So I think I still need to go through those issues a bit. Maybe Tim and anyone else is interested, we can sort of, like, go through and do a quick scan and see if there's anything sort of low hanging fruit where we can help move that along.","{'anger': 0.007524862885475159, 'disgust': 0.04358160123229027, 'fear': 0.011207864619791508, 'joy': 0.004171303939074278, 'neutral': 0.5933788418769836, 'sadness': 0.29507267475128174, 'surprise': 0.045062847435474396}",0.007524862885475159,0.04358160123229027,0.011207864619791508,0.004171303939074278,0.5933788418769836,0.29507267475128174,0.045062847435474396,1
Speaker A,"Okay, great. The next item is a net new package manager integration with Nuget. This is one of our. This, I think, is our stage's highest requested feature with something like 127 votes. Now, I've had this. A few customers recently request this as well. I still need to groom this issue, so it's a little out of date, but that's the next item that we need to work on, and I should have that done. This week for sure, but expect it'll look like the Conan MVC issue. Which, by the way, Steve, was anything missing from that that you think that I should focus on? Or was there too much detail in that one that I should exclude from as I build out the Nuget one?","{'anger': 0.005112408194690943, 'disgust': 0.003543896833434701, 'fear': 0.0014098496176302433, 'joy': 0.014257572591304779, 'neutral': 0.9366427659988403, 'sadness': 0.003076713066548109, 'surprise': 0.035956889390945435}",0.005112408194690943,0.003543896833434701,0.0014098496176302433,0.014257572591304779,0.9366427659988403,0.003076713066548109,0.035956889390945435,4
Speaker E,"I don't think there's anything in particular one way or the other. Certainly. Like, more information is better, I think. Yeah.

Speaker D,"And Tim, I think the other big lesson that we should take away from how we were working on Conan was that it took a lot of investigation upfront by Krause to get to a point where we could kind of move forward and even start breaking things up. I think we want to. I think you would have done this already, but it's worth mentioning is to say that we should have some sort of investigation effort included upfront so that people have the opportunity to do that. So that would be my main takeaway from how Conan's gone so far.","{'anger': 0.008054385893046856, 'disgust': 0.011486176401376724, 'fear': 0.002176416339352727, 'joy': 0.0033077881671488285, 'neutral': 0.9678716063499451, 'sadness': 0.003377394750714302, 'surprise': 0.0037262497935444117}",0.008054385893046856,0.011486176401376724,0.002176416339352727,0.0033077881671488285,0.9678716063499451,0.003377394750714302,0.0037262497935444117,2
Speaker A,"Yeah, I think we're thinking that anytime we do one of these integrations, it would take two milestones. One for sort of the investigation and getting the API stubbed out, and then the second one for finishing it and testing it and getting it working. That's what Steve and I talked about, at least. So, yeah. Should I create an investigation issue, or should I more say, this is the thing, here's as much detail as we could find, and then just understand that the process will take, the misters that come from the main issue will break that work up.","{'anger': 0.012690036557614803, 'disgust': 0.013475727289915085, 'fear': 0.0032772195991128683, 'joy': 0.0016083543887361884, 'neutral': 0.955525279045105, 'sadness': 0.0063561745919287205, 'surprise': 0.0070672971196472645}",0.012690036557614803,0.013475727289915085,0.0032772195991128683,0.0016083543887361884,0.955525279045105,0.0063561745919287205,0.0070672971196472645,6
Speaker D,"I think my main takeaway, to just characterize it a little better, or more, depending on how you look at it, is that that investigation would have helped us come to a conclusion about how to deliver an MVC faster. So that's the goal of the investigation, not to fully document all of the possibilities, because that ends up putting us behind a whole set of investigation that, yes, delivers knowledge and helps us understand how to make decisions. And that's awesome. But we should focus that investigation effort on how do we deliver an MVC most minimum viable change that's actually useful in this area from this investigation. Because then we can make sure we're not just sort of researching for a month or whatever. Does that make sense?","{'anger': 0.013554167933762074, 'disgust': 0.025360964238643646, 'fear': 0.0019759847782552242, 'joy': 0.007209921721369028, 'neutral': 0.9375318288803101, 'sadness': 0.0024821232073009014, 'surprise': 0.01188500877469778}",0.013554167933762074,0.025360964238643646,0.0019759847782552242,0.007209921721369028,0.9375318288803101,0.0024821232073009014,0.01188500877469778,3
Speaker A,"It makes sense to me, and I think it's going to be, we're going to be in a lot better place with Nuget than we are with Conan because the documentation is way better and way more thorough, it seems, than nugethen. They actually have some. It's well talked about. It's, it's.

Speaker A,"Okay, cool. Okay, next up we have three, four smallish changes. Not smallish, but the first one is adding sorting for packages, the packages list at the group and project level. Nick said this would probably likely break down into a few or a couple of misters, but basically if you click through the issue, the idea is that on the group list, we're not doing any sorting for the packages list and we can. So I think that's something that Nick's already started to tackle. Actually, the next one on there is checking for Docker images before renaming a group. So if you remember, there's some issue where if you have a bad. If you have a special character in your project group or branch name, it will break the connection to Docker, which is obviously a problem. And we have logic in there. So if you go to change your project name, you'll get a warning and you could see it in the issue. What happens now? You get like a big red banner. It says cannot rename project because it contains registry tags. We should just do the same thing for group.

Ideally in my head, we, as a package, gets loaded into the proxy, it's scanned by those same sets of tools, if possible, because trying to maintain some understanding of how this stuff fits together is going to be a lot of a big lift for a small team like us. And none of that makes sense. Right, sorry. That was a very dismissive way to put it. If it doesn't make sense, then I'm happy to hear arguments. Otherwise. Sorry. And I think the thing I was going to say is I think we ought to be discussing the comments that have been raised around the dependency proxy, that I can just add a flag to the docker distribution registry to run it in proxy mode. And what the dependency proxy does that's different from that, because I've seen that come up from end users, from our customers. And so I, like, I couldn't answer that question. How is it different from just running VDR in proxy mode? I don't know.","{'anger': 0.014557904563844204, 'disgust': 0.06964379549026489, 'fear': 0.0035902068484574556, 'joy': 0.005817305762320757, 'neutral': 0.8826566338539124, 'sadness': 0.01949671469628811, 'surprise': 0.004237440414726734}",0.014557904563844204,0.06964379549026489,0.0035902068484574556,0.005817305762320757,0.8826566338539124,0.01949671469628811,0.004237440414726734,15

Speaker D,"Yeah. So do you want me to add an issue to investigate or do you want to add that issue or. It doesn't have to be in here, but we should. I think we ought to be discussing this before it sort of testing a bunch of effort in dependency proxy just to make sure we're clear on what we should be providing. And our intention is to provide further support for proxying in the dependency proxy, for other stuff other than docker distribution registry or aka the container registry. So this isn't just the.
