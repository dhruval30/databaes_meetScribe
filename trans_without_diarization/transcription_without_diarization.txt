THE SURVEY OUT THE THEYI HAVE AN EXISTING PANNEL WITH TICKETS AND SURVEY TOOYEP THEY'RE GOING TA SEND IT TO THE EXISTING PANNEL UM THE PANNEL ISN'T VERY LARGE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHERCREATIVE WAYS TO GETPEOPLE TO TAKE THE SURVEY WHETHER IT'S PICKING PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW WRIDING ONER ISSUES OR UM YOU KNOW SIRP CHERRING IT ON TWITTER THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFEREN OPTIONSOK GOL ALL RIGHT SO THE NEXT ITEM I HAVE IS REVIEWING THE TWELVE POINT FOUR MILE STONE SOI HAVE THE WINK INCLUDED THERE COL JUST PULL UP THE ISSUIST IF YOU WANTTA PULL IT UP I HAVE IT SORTED I KNOW DAN HATES WHEN I SHARE MY SCREEN BUT IIT'S I HAVE ETSORTED TO MANUAL IF YOU LOOK IN THE SORT TROP DOWN BOX UM THE MANNUAL SORT WILL PICK UP THE SORT THAT I INCLUDED IN THE UH THE BBOARD LIST SO IT'S IN PRIORITY ORDER AND THEN WE COULD GO THROUGH EACH ITEM THERE SOUND GOOD OK SO THE FIRST ITEM ON THERE IS THEDOCOR DISTRIBUTION PRUNER FROM EXPERIMENTAL TO G A THIS COULD BE AN INVESTIGATION TASK THIS IS A TENN I WERE TALKING LAST WEEK ABOUT WHEATHER OR NOTAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE FORKING THE DOCTOR CODE AND OPTOMIZING THE GARBAGE CLUTCHIANG CODE THAT'S THERE OR TAKING WHED UH CAMILE HAS ALREADY DONE WITH THIS STACKFER DISTRIBUTIONER DISTRIBUTION PRUNER CODE WHICH IS WORKING FOR SOME CUSTOMERS SARA MENTIONED SHE'S USING THIS UH FOR SOME PEOPLE TO ONT SUPPORT CALLS BUT ITI'VE SEEN WHERE THERE'SE ISUES WITH BACK IT CAUSES ISSUES WITH PACKUPS OR SOME OTHER THINGS WHERE IT JUST DOESN'T WORKBUT WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE FASTEST WAY TO IMPROVINGIING THE GARBAGE COLLECTION STORY FOR SOME OF OUR BIG CUSTOMERS AH SOME THAT WE MET WITH LAST WEEK THAT ARE HAVING YOU KNOW FIFTY FIVE TERRABITES AT STORAGE SAT RE USING IN IN THEIRE REGISTRY AND THEY THEY JUST CAN'T USE THE CURRENT VERSION OF GARBAGE COLLECTION SO IN THIS ISSUED IT'S UM HIDLINKS TO CAMILES CODEAMD A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY BUT REALLY WE NEED TO LIKE DIVE IN AND INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT IF THAT'S POSSIBLEAD AND PROBABLY A CONVERSATION WITH CANILE IS WORTH WORTHWHILEI'M TO SEE WHAT WHAT HE TAKES AS WELL SO UH CHALL YOU INTERJECT TIN UH YEAH I'VE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH THE CODE AND LIST OF ISSUES MOST OF THE ISSUES IN THAT UUM PROJECT AL KIND OF AT BEST A YEAR OLD SO UH I THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GO THROUGH LAZITION TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CANSIDER START AD DRESSINGRELATIVELY QUICKLY BUT WE MIGHT END UP HAVING TWO AND THIS IS THE ISSUES IN THE UM UH UH WHAT IS IT P MTE THE PACKAGE WAT IT THE PRINA SORRY THE CATAN REGISTRY PRNA UM DOTLOR SPICIAN PRINA OR WHATEVER HE'S CALLED IT AMD SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GO THROGH THIS ISSUE TO FIGURE OUTE 'N ANYTHING THERE WE CAN ACTUALLY JUST KIND OF GO HEY LET'S GO DO THIS UM AND IT SEEMSD LIKE A LOT OF THEM AS BACK AND FORWARD WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CONTRIBUTE SO UM I THINK I STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THOSE ISSUES A BIT MAYBE TIM UH AND I NOWONE ELSE IS INTERESTED WE GET SORT OF LIKE DOTRO AND AND DO A QUICK SCAN AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO THE PLO HANGN FRUIT WHERE WE CAN HELP U I U MOVE THAT ALONGOK GREAT UH THE NEXT ITEM IS A NET DU PACKAGE MANAGER INTIGRATION WITH NEW GET THIS IS ONE OF OUR THIS I THINKNK IS OUR STAGES HIGHEST REQUESTED FEATURE IT'S UNTIL LIKE A HUNDRED AMTWENTY SEVEN VOTES NOW UM U I'VE HADD THIS A FEW CUSTOMERS RECENTLY REQUEST THIS AS WELL AM I STILL NEED TO GRIM THIS ISSUE SO IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF DATE BUT UH THAT'S THE NEXT ITEM TA WOR WE NEED TO WORK ON ANDUH I SHOULD HAVE THAT DONE THIS WEEK FOR SURE UM BUT EXPECT IT'LL LOOK LIKE THE CONAN M B C ISSUE WHICH BY THE WAY STEVE AS ANYTHING MISSING FROM THAT LET ME THINK THAT I SHOULD FOKASAN OR IT WAS THERE TOO MUCH DETAIL IN THAT ONE THAT I SHSH YOU KNOW SHOULD EXCLUDE FROM AS I AS I BUILD OUT THE NUGET ONE UM I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHINGN PARTICULAR ONE WAY OR THE OTHER UM CERTAINLY LIKE YOU KNOW MORE INFORMATION IS BETTER UM I THINK IT YEAH LIKE AS SORT OF HAVING ESTOP LEVEL ISSUE THAT CAN EVENTUALLY BE BROKEN DOWN BY WHOEVER'S WORKING ON IT AS NEEDED I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD GOOD PLACE TO START OK CAL AR ABOUT AGAINTIM I THINK THE OTHER BIG LESSON THAT WE SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM HOW WEWERE WORKING ON CANON WAS THAT IT TOOK A LOT OF INVESTIGATION UPFRONT BY CRAST TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WEYOU CIN OF MOVE FORWARD AND EVEN START BREAKING THINGS UP BU THINK WE WANTA I I'M I'M THINK YOU WOULD HAVE DONE US AREALY BUT IT'S WORTH MENTIONING IS TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION EFFORT INCOWOD EN UP FRONT SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT UM UH SO THAT WOULD BE MY MAIN TAKE AWAY FROM HOW CONAN'S GON SAPFA TAKE LER I THINK WE'RE THINKINGWEAT ANYTIME WE DO ONE OF THESE INTEGRATIONS IT WOULD TAKE TWO MILE STONES ONE FOR SORT OF THE INVESTIGATION AND GETTING THE A P I STUBBED OUT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE FORFFINISHING IT AND TESTING IT AND GETTING IT WORKING TAT THAT'S WHAT STEVEN I LIKE ABATTLDO SO UH YEAH I THINK LIKE SHOULD I CRADE IN THE BEESTIGATION ISSUE OR SHOULD I MORE SAY THIS IS THE THING HERE'S AS MUCH DETAIL AS WE CAN FIND AND I'M JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROCESS WILL TAKE S THE THEMUR AS THAT COME FROM THE MAIN ISSUE WILL BREAK THAT WORK UP I I THINK I THINK MY MAIN TAKE AWAY TO JUST CHARACTERIZE IT A LITTLE BETTER OR MORETHING I HATE LOOK AT IT IS THAT THAT INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE HELPED US COME TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT HOW TO DELIVER AN M B C PLASTA UM SO THATHAT'S THE GOAL OF THE INVESTIGATION NOT TO FULLY DOCUMENT ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE THAT ENDS UP PUTTING US BEHIND A WHOLE SET OFTHE INVESTIGATION  BUT YES TO LEV US KNOWLEDGE INOP TUS UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS AND THATS ARSOME BAT WE SHOULD FOCUS THAT INVESTIGATION EFFORT ON HOW DO WE DELIVER AN  M B C A MOST UH A MINIMUM VIABLE CHANGE UHTHAT'S ACTUALLY USEFUL AH IN THIS AREA FROM THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THEN WE CAN LIKE MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT JUSSAT OF RESEARCHING FOR A MONTH OR WHATEVER IS THAT AN INECTIT MAKES SENSE TO ME AND I THINK IT'S GOINGNA BE A WE'RE GOINGNA BE IN A LOT BETTER PLACE WITH NUGETAMIR WITH CONAN BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION IS WAY BETTERUM AND WAY MORE THORROW IT SEEMS THAN THAN NOU GET THATILL OCOM HAVE SOME THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOME IT'S WELL TALKED ABOUT IT'S IT'S I THINK WE'RE GOING TA BEIN AMUT IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE BUT AND I DID CREATE AS A SIDE NOTE UM ECRATED AN ISSUE FOR KIND OF JUST DISCUSSINGG LIKE WHEN WE ARE IMPLEMENTINGYOU UM PACKAGE SYSTEMS IN GENERAL SORT OF YOUNOW THINGS WE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY AND MAYBE SOME NOTES ABOUT HOW WE CAN BREAK THINGS UP IN A GENERAL UMSENSE WHEN WE ATTACK EACH NEW ONE UM I'LL I'LL THROW A LINCEN HERE AS WELLTHERE'LL BE HELPFULL THANK YOUARE YOU IN A SLAP CHEK IN E SUMN CHAPDI'LL JUST AD IT TO THE DOCCUMENT OK CO UM OK NEXT STEPWE HAVE THREE UM FOUR SMALL SMALL SH CHANGES NOT SMALLSH BUT AMD THE FIRST ONE IS ADDING SORTINGON FOR PACKAGES THE PACKAGES LIST AT THE GROUP AND PROJECT LEVEL AND NICK SAID THE C PA LIKELY BREAK DOWN INTO INTO T A FEW OR A COUPLE OF MMARS UM BUT BASICALLY IF YOU IF YOU QUIK THROUGH THE ISSUE UM THE IDEA IS THAT OM THE GROUP LATS WERE NOT DOING ANY SORTING FOR THE PACKAGE OF WOPPACKAGES LESS THAN WECAN UM SO II THINK THAT'S SOMETHING I NEXT READY STARTED TO TACKLE ACTUALLY UM THE NEXT ONEON THERE IS CHECKING FOR DARKER IMAGES BEFORE RENAMING A GROUP SO IF YOU REMEMBER THERE THERE'S SOME ISSUE WHERE IF YOU HAVE A BAD UHIF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL CHARACTER IN YOUR PROJECT GROUP OR BRANCH NAME IT WILL BREAK THE CONNECTION TO DOCOR AMD WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM ANAND WE HAVE LOGIC IN THERE SO IF YOU GO TO CHANGE YOUR PROJECT NAME YOU'LL GET A A WARNING AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE ISSUE WHAT HAPPENS NOW YOU GET LIKE A BIG RED BANNER IT SAYS CANNOT REDAN PRODJECT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS UH REGISTRY TAX THAT'LL UH WE SHOULD JUST DO THE SAME THING FOR A GROUP BASICALLY THIS THIS CAME FROM A BUGUM I WA'S JUST MAKING A ALOGIC CHANGE ON THE UNDE FRONER TO TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LET USERS HANG THEMSELVES THAT WAY THIS MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO GET EASILY GROPPD WITH I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING BUT FOR M BM AND MATEN PACKAGES BECAUSE THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN IS HE RENAME THE GROUP OR THE PASTUM TO THE GROUP IT'LL JUST BREAK THE PACKAGES UM THE LENGTHS OF THE PACKAGES SO I'M ASSUMING I THINK I LOOKED INTO IT BREEFLY AND IT'S LIKE ALL THAT COO ON LIVES IN THE SAME SPOT SO IT'LD BE EASY TO CHANGE ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIMEOH COOL DO YOU THINKOF DO YOU THINK I SHOULD EXPAND THIS ISSUE TO SAY OR JUSTRIP I THINK THERE THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE SOMEWHERE THAT I I PROBABLY CREATED ONE WORKING ON I THINK THE MAVAN SIDE OF THINGS UMSO WE COULD JUST PROBABLY ADD THAT TO THE SMILE STOR OK CAN YOU SEND THAT TO ME AO I'LL I'LL MAKE THE UPPLIN YEAHYEAH I THINK YOU ONYOU WAN AR PRIORITIZE VALIDATING THE THEORY THAT YOU CAN CHANGE IT IN ONE PLACE AND THENILL IMPACT EVERYTHING ELSE BE BEFORE WE GO HEADDING IT BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T IF IF THAT'S NOT GONGTA HAPPEN THENN WHEN YOU GO TO ADIT AND IT'LL BE IN THE MILES TIME THEN YOU HAVE TO JO P  LIKE ANOVE SET A WORD TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO IT'S PROBABLY WORTH LEAVING JUST THE ONE IN HERE SENDING IT TO TIM LIKE YOU REQUESTEDAND THEN IF WE CAN GET IT OR WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO DO BOTH AND WE WOULD WE WOULD PUT IT IN UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT'S JON YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE GIT LABBYEST WAY TO DO THIS I'M GIVING THAT YOU'VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN THE REST OF USYEAH THANKS STAND UM I WOULD YEAH I WOULI SAY WE DEFINIELY NEED AVALODY AT THE APPROACH WHY WHY DON'T WE I IF WE UM LET NICK HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO RESEARCH THAT AND JUST DIG IN QUICKLY THAT SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEMLB A GOOD APPROACH BEFORE TWELVE FOUROK YEAH THAT'S SOLLY FINE I'M W I THINK UH IF WE DRESS IT FIRST FOR THE DARK RIMAGI IS AND AND WELL I'LL PUT IT IN A RELATED ISSUES AND I THINK IT'LL DEFINITELY BE WORTHY OF A A NEW M R UH JUST BASED ON OUR TEAM LODGECT SO UM MAYY BE WORTHY WORTHY OF A SEPARATE ISSUE AS WELL JUS JUST IN CASEHASH TAG OK AGAY OK SO THIRS THAT ONE AND THEN THE NEXT ONE IS VERY SMALL I WAS GOINGTO TRY TO DO THIS WORE MYSELF UM JUST TO GO THROUGH THE M R PROCESS AND FEEL THE PAIN BY THE HELPPPOINT THAT WE HAVE IN UM IN SETTINGS LENGTHS TO THE MAVON REPOSITORY FOR PACKAGES IT SHOULD LINKE TO THE NEW UMCOMBINEDM UH DOCUMENTATION THAT WE HAVE FOR THE ALL PACKAGE REGISTRIES SO JUST AS A SMALL HELP T AH CHANGE IN THE FRONT NDAND THEN UH I'LL GO AHEAD SORRY TIM DID YOU SAY YOUWERE GONGNA UH GRAB THAT ISUE I THINK WI SOLL GIVE IT A NECK TO SOO BECAUSE IF IT'S ON ME THEN I CAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT ANDN IF I DON'T GET IT DONE HAVE IT FELL REALLY BAD AM I THINK NICKL SOLD DO IT MUCH FASTER BUT I WANTED TO I WA I JUST WANTED ASOS SOM SOLIDEARTY BUT IT'S THANKS FOR THANKS FOR THE GIT LABBY APPROACH TO THAT ONE JONT I KNO OK UMUH IT'S AF THREE MORE UM I HAVE THE ATHENTIC FOR WITH UH FOR C I JOB TOKEN FOROR CONAN AND FOR M P M I'M NOT SURE OF THE PRIORITY OF THOSE I THINK WE COULD I KNOW M PM PEOPLE ARE AT CUS CUSTOMERS ARE ASKING FOR ITS TAT WHAY A MUCH HIGHER REEQUESTED FEATURE BUT I KNOW ONCE PEOPLE START USING CONAN WI'LL GET IT I GUESS I WOULD PRIORITIZE THE M PM ONE ABOVE CONIN IN THIS CASE UMAND THEN AND THEN FINALLY THE THE COLLECTING DATA AND AND USAGE MEASURES FOR THE OUR STAGE TA TAKUIT PARTICULARLY FOR THE CONTAINER REGISTRY ANDI THOK J GS CAL WORK WELL OUTYEAH I WIL DEFINITELY AGREE THAT AN PM WE GO ABOVE KINAN IN THIS CASEUM JUST BECAUSEIT IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PAIN POINT WE'VE ALSO MISSED IT A COUPLE  AT LEAST ONCE SIR I DEFINITELY THINK THAT'S WORTHWHILE UM MESWICHING MAY ORDER A POST TIPYEAH I JUST I I JUST FLIPPED IT I THINK I TRAED I THINK THE CONAMONT CALD PROBABLY WAIT TIL TWELVE FIVE EVEN IF WE HAD TO UM I COULD LEAVE IT IN THERE AND IF WE GETTO A GRAPE BED IF NO THAT'S OK I TICK ITCALWAIT TILL THE THE NEXT MILE STAL IT COULD  DEPENDING ON WHAT DEMAND WE GET FOR I IT COULD ALSO BE A REALLY GOOD ONBOARDING ISSUE FOR THE NEXTUH TAM MEMBER WE HAVE JOINING IN OCTOBER OH YEAH IS IVITORILY WELL DOCUMENTED WHAT PROCESS IS IT MEANS THAT I CAN REACH APE A HELP AND AND ANSER THAT MIGHT BE A GOODONE TO SORT OF TO HAVE OUT THERE UM AND I I THINK THE THREAT I'M GETTING AS WELL FROM ALL OF THE RESEARCH OR ALL OF THE RESEARCH FOR THE RESEARCH THAT I'VESAIMG THE THE  N'S DOING AND EVERYONE'S CONTRIBUTING TOYOU IS THAT PEOPLE USE C I PIPELINES TH THE PIPELINES A LOT TO INTERACT WITH THE STUFF SO I THINK THIS IS GOINGTA BEOD VALUE GENERALLY SO I LIKE THE THAT WAY IT'S REQUIRETIZING IT AM IT IT DEALS LIKE WE HAD A DISCUSSION A LITTLE WHILE AGONPRICING AND WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE IN THE THE UM FREE TEARS OR YOU KNOW C E ALL THAT'S CHANGING UM UH SO I FEEL LIKE SOME OF THESE THINGS WI IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE THAT I KNOW OF TM AND AND UH ND YUSR OF THINKING A MIS IN THIS RESPECT BUT THAT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE SORT OF HAVING A THINK ABOUT WHETHER SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE WORTHIN WELL TOGETHER AS A YOU KNOW AS AN ENTERPRISE EDITION OR A NOT UM IF WE'RE ADDING THESE TO E E AND PEOPLE ONLY RELEASE OF THE PIPELINES BUT THEN THEY CAN'T REALLY DO IT IDON'T IOPAER IT ALL WORKS THAT WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN UM WELL WEWOULD PROBABLY I THINK THE DISCUSSION FOR MESIOLD BE SHOULD THE PACKAGE REGISTRIES BE AT ENTERPRISE FEECHRFORR A CONSUMER FUTURE IN MY IN MY OPINION THE I THINK I AGREE WITH JHASON'S POINT IN THAT ISSUE THAT THEY SHOULD BE A CONSUMER FEATURE AM BUT THATI SHE'S STILL GOING THROUGH DISCUSSION AND UM SOME HIGHER UP STRATOGY TO FIGURE THAT STUFF OUT BUT IN MY OPINION I I WOULD LOVE IT FOR FOR DOBBY UH CONSUMEERYEAH IT FEELS LIKE TO ME AND ANDAAM WHEN I LIKE GET TO AHEAD OF WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWAY BUT UM TO ME IT FEELIT WAS LIKE THEY PROBABLY SHOULD BE AN I MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT THAT WAY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO UM I FEELS LIKE THEY SHOULD BE CONSUMER AND IT FEELS LIKE SOME THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW THER THEONE OF THE ITEMS WE HAVE TO DISCUSSING HERE SHOULD BE SORT OF ENTERPRISE ALOU H SECURITY SCANNING STUFF FOR THE ACTUAL PROXY UM TE WAY OF COMING UP AT'S UM I'M GOYEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT OKY SO THAT'S THAT'S TWELVE FOUR I STILL WORKING ON THE NEWGET ISSUE AND AND I'LL MAKE SOME CHANGES THIS WEEK BASED ON SOMEOF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD BUT ANY GENERAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNSI HAD ONE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE UM LUGET THE DIAD NET PACKAGE MANAGER UM I'M I QUICKLY SCANN THE ISSUE AND I'LL DO A LITTLE MORE DUDILIGENCE BUT UH IS ANYBODY AWARE THAT THAT WILL NEED UM SOME FRONT END EFFORT OR DO WE THINK THAT'S MOSTLYBACKINFOCRATOTHE FIRST MILESTONE LIKE THIS MILE STONE WILL PROBABLY BE THE INVESTIGATION AN THE APIS AND THEN THE NEXT MILE STONEOL IT'LL BE FRN END BUT I IT'LL DETANGIT'LL PROBABLY BE VERY CLOSE TO THE SAME FRONT ND THAT WE HAVE FOR ANKIM AND MAVIN JUST DIFFERENT MEDADAA THAT FITS INTO THOSE COLOMS UH CONIN WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAD A EXPANDABLE UH SETTINGS PIACE AM I DON'T THINK NUGET'LL HAVE THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DON'TIT DOESN'T CARRY AS MUCH OF THAT MEDADATA BUT I I'LL KNOW MORE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS I AS I LOOK AT IT I'VE JUST BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET IT RUNNING ON MY COMPUTER BECAUSE IT'SUH I HAVE A MACK IN THAT A WINDOWS MACHINE YOUR AN SOM JUST UH WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE KINKS THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A UH SOMETHING YOU CAL USE CALLED SALTOR SOMETHING LIKE I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT UM I JUST WANTO MAKE

LITTLE BIT OF TIME NOW BUT UM WHEN I MY PREVIOUS ROLL WEWERE MOVINGEVERYTHING TO DOTNET CORP SO WE CAN RUN ON MACK O S AND LENICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT DOES THAT HELP IN THE SITUATION AT ALL ORYEAH CAL THEY HAVE SOMETHING HAVE ANOTHER THAT DOWNLOAD THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AMDUSE AT AND THEN YOU COULD USE IT FROM VISUAL STUDEO ORE YOU COULD USE IT FROM THE COMMAND LINE I THINK WE WANTO JUSTCOVER THE COMMAND LINE USE CASE AND AND MSS IN THIS CASE BUT UMYEH WE DO HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN COR AND STANDARD AM I THINK I FORGET WHICH ONE WE SHOULD LEAN TO WHICHEVER ONE IS LIKE THE MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED NOW WE SHOULD USEYAND THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT COR AND THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT FILES FOR THE MEDADADA THEY HAVE LIKE PACKAGE CANFEG AND THEND THEY HAVE ANOTHER ONE THAT'S CALLED SOMETHING STRANGE AND THE THIS DISTRANGER ONE IS THE NEWER ONESNO IT'S AT'S PACKAGE DOT SOMETHING STRANGE APPARENTLY YEAH THAT'S THE CT DEFINITELY THE NAME LACK AND STRANGE VEH BUTHODALL RIGHT THANKS TO APPRECIATE IT NO PROBLEM UM OK YES LIKE I MENTIONED THE NEXT ONE ON THERE ISAH THE DEPENDENCY FIREWALL WHICH IS A NET NEW CATEGORY THAT I CAME UP FROM A CONVERSATION WITH SID AND KENNY WHERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT UH US DOING SOMEOMETHING LIKE THIS UH AND T BUILDING OFF OF THE DEPENDENCY PROXY TO BUILD IN SOME ADDITIONAL SECURITY FEATURES THE YOU KNOW J FRAG HAS THEIRX RAY PRODUCT AND SEDOTAPE HAS A FIREWALL PRODUCT EVERYBODY 'S INCORPORATING THI STUFF THE YOU KNOW M PM ENTERPRISE IS TRYING TO BUILD THEIR HOLE VALUE CHANEIN OFF OF UH SECURITY SCANNING SO IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO UM I CREATED A A NEW CATEGORY AND SOME CONTENT FOR THE STRATAGY AND DIRECTION PAGE ALONG WITH SOMESCALITAN ISSUES THAT WE COULD REVIEW AM BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WAS AWARE OF IT AND HAD THE CHANCE TO IN THE ISSUE PROVIDE ANY UH FEET BACKOR OR THOUGHT BEFOREK I'M MERGEDOR IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER WHATI WHAT I CAN EVEN THOUGH KNOWING IT'S UH NOT WE'RE NOT CAN TO GET TO THIS UNTILTWENTY TWENTY WELL UR DID WE DECIDE ON DEPENDENCY FIREWALL ALREADY IS THE NAME THAT'S WHAT SIGHT SUGGESTED UM ORIGINALLY THEYHAD ARTIFACT ANALISIS BUT UM HE'LL LHAVE TO COMMENT IN THERE SAYING THATT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ARTIFACTS THERE DEPENDANTIES ANDSOMEONEIONEDDUPLIATIONFTHE USE OF THE WORD ATOFFACINYEAH AND IT'S NOT  IT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT I GUESS NAMING WHY SO WEWE ENDED UP AT TEPENDENCY FIREWALL WE COULD ALWAYS CHANGEUD IT IF WE HAD A GOOD JUSTIFICATION I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HELPS GRAND THAT SECTION T LIKE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING DEPENDENCY PROXY AND DEPENDENCYIROW ALL THE ENTERPRISE FEATURES AND FUTURES THAT YOU PAY FOR I THINK IT HELPS BRAND THEM AM AND IT SAYS EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DOING WHICH I THINK IS ALSALL TE GET LABWAYS I THOUGHT SAID DID A GOOD JOB AT WUT NAMING IT UM BU YEA WEEK IF YOU HAVE OTHER IDEAS WE GOT SURE WE COULD TALK ABOUT ITUM YEAH I I DON'T THINK I HAVE ABR IDEAS RIGHT NOW THAT AREN'T JUST DUMB JOKES SO I'M GONG TO LEAVE THEM OUTMUH BUT WHAT I AM LOOKING AT HERES I I THINKTHERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE WE OUGHT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE THE SECURITY TAMES WORK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HERE I I'M GOINGNTO BE RECREATING THE WHEEL UM IDEALLY IN MY HEAD WE WEAS A PACKAGE GETS T LOADED WITH A PROXY IT' SCANED BY THOSE SAME SETS OF TOOLS IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW TRY TO MAINTAIN SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE STUFF IT'S TOGETHERSI'S GON TA BE A LOT OF A BIG LIFT FOR A SMALL TEAM LIKE US UM AND NON OFANO MAKE SENSE RIGHT SORRY THAT WAS A VERY DISMISSIVE WAY TO PUT IT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THEN I'M HAPPYHAHER ARGUMENTS OTHERWISE SORRY UM AND AND I THINK UH I THINKOTHER THING I WAS GOING TA SAY IS I I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DISSICUSSING THAT THAT THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RAISER AND THE DEPENDENCY PROPCY THAT I CAN JUST ADD A FLAG TO THE DOCT SHOULD BECH REGISTRIED AND RUN IT IN PROXY MODE UM AND WHATTHE DEPENDENCY PROXY DOES THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT UM BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT COME UP FROM AND USES FROM OUR CUSTOMERS UM AND SO I LIKE II COULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM JUST RUNNING PD R N IN UM PROXIMOADE I DON'T KNOW YEAH I WOULD THINK WE NEED TOA INVESTIGCATE THAT PROBABLY YEAH SO THAT CAL WE UH DO YOU WANT AN AD AN ISSUE DANVERSTIGATE OR DO YOU WANT TA AD THAT ISSUE OR I DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN HERE BUT WE SHOULD I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DISCUSSING THIBEFOR IT UM BEFORE IT SOLUT SOP I  PCE TESTING A BUNCH PD IN THE KN AN PROXY JUST TO MAKE YOUR WAY CLEAR ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING AND IN HOOUR INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR PROPTYING IN THE DEPENDANCY POPTY FOR OTHER STUFF OTHER THAN DOKDISHPUTION REGISTRY OR AKA THE CONTAINER REGISTRY SO THIS ISN'T JUST AAH WELL OK WE DON'T NEED IT IT'S MORE LIKE OK WELL
